Probabilistic Robotics Notes

Welcome to Probabilistic Robotics Notes — a structured collection of study notes, explanations, and references for probabilistic robotics, based on the foundational book Probabilistic Robotics by Thrun, Burgard & Fox.

This repository is intended to help learners, students, and robotics enthusiasts deepen their understanding of probabilistic approaches used in robotic perception, state estimation, and decision-making under uncertainty.

📚 Contents

The repository is organized into the following main sections:

📘 Chapters

Detailed written notes on key probabilistic robotics topics (e.g., Bayes filters, Kalman filters, particle filters, SLAM fundamentals). (See: Chapters/ directory)

🎓 Lectures

Lecture slides, summaries, or extended explanations covering important concepts in probabilistic robotics. (See: Lectures/ directory)

🧠 What Is Probabilistic Robotics?

Probabilistic robotics is a paradigm in robotics focused on handling uncertainty in robot perception and control. Instead of deterministic models, probabilistic methods explicitly model uncertainty and noise — enabling robots to make robust decisions in real-world environments.

This approach includes topics such as:

Bayesian state estimation and recursive filtering

Kalman filters (standard, extended)

Histogram and particle filters

Localization and mapping (SLAM)

Probabilistic models of perception and motion
