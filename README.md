# Probabilistic Robotics Notes
Welcome to **Probabilistic Robotics Notes**
A structured collection of study notes, explanations, and references for _probabilistic robotics_ based on both the canonical textbook **Probabilistic Robotics** and a curated set of video lectures.

This repository is intended to help learners, students, and robotics enthusiasts deepen their understanding of probabilistic approaches used in robotic perception, state estimation, and decision-making under uncertainty.

## 📚 Contents
The repository is organized into:
### 📘 Chapters
Detailed written notes on key probabilistic robotics topics (e.g., Bayes filters, Kalman filters, particle filters, SLAM fundamentals). _(See: `Chapters/` directory)_
### 🎓 Lectures
Lecture slides, summaries, or extended explanations covering important concepts in probabilistic robotics. _(See: `Lectures/` directory)_

## 🧠 What Is _Probabilistic Robotics_?
Probabilistic robotics is a paradigm in robotics focused on handling uncertainty in robot perception and control. Instead of deterministic models, probabilistic methods explicitly model uncertainty and noise enabling robots to make robust decisions in real-world environments.

This approach includes topics such as:
- Bayesian state estimation and recursive filtering
- Kalman filters (standard, extended)
- Histogram and particle filters
- Localization and mapping (SLAM)
- Probabilistic models of perception and motion
